        <h2>ComS 309 - Project Machete</h2>
        <img src="img/machete.jpg"></img>
        
        <p>ComS 309 is a software engineering class that stresses the importance of solid design and planning. You can't just sit down and code on a major project and expect it to work well. The course asks us to form teams and pick a significant programming project. We decided to build an application that would host a physics engine on a server. The server would send object data to clients that would then render them using OpenGL. The project was initially named WiiPhys, because we were planning on using WiiMotes as the primary client input. As the semester went on we realized that this, and other frill, such as fluid simulation, would just be too much for our short timescale. We ultimately decided to focus on the core functionality; a real-time multi-user physics simulation.</p>

        <p>This class taught me a lot about the realistic limitations of software development. It's easy to dream big, but there are always issues that cause delays, and these delays have to be accounted for. I feel like we came out with a very solid product in the end. The final iteration is fully connected to the server, takes user input by mouse, allows the user to hit things with a stick, and adds cool things like random blasts of force and gravity inversion.</p>

        <p>I had an amazing team for this project. Everyone seemed to be very skilled at one facet of the project: I had done a lot of GUI building, and was the only member with solid OpenGL experience, another team member works on large scale computing projects, and already knew a lot about how to get the physics working, the last member was an expert on networking. This type of setup really emphasized the importance of writing easy to use code, because I was the only one that really knew what was going on in the OpenGL code, and vice versa.</p>
