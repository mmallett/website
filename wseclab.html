            <p>I'm a Software Engineer at IBM Somers near New York City. My current focuses are on cloud native and massively scalable applications, but I have been experimenting in mobile and front-end development as well.</p>

        <p>Our task is to stand up a virtualized network to be used by CprE537 (wireless security) students as a lab environment. The lab provides a safe and controlled environment for students to perform experiments that would be frowned upon on a true network. Our team is building upon the work of a previous senior design team. In addition to getting their solution running on a new environment, we are designing an addition that will allow students to intercept and analyze cell phone traffic.</p>

        <p>The network is virtualized dynamically with VMware ESXi 4.1. When a student requests access to his or her virtual machine for lab experiments, the system deploys the student's stored hard drive image. This gives each student complete control of their environment, while still isolating the environment, so changes made do not interfere with other students' experiments. There are 3 types of virtual machines that students have control over. A client/attack node pair is deployed where students can generate and intercept wireless traffic, and an OpenBTS (Open Base Transceiver Station) machine allows students to transform a National Instruments hardware radio into a cell phone tower to send and receive GSM (Global System for Mobile) signals.</p>

        <p>In addition to the student VMs, there will be a administration/web server virtual machine that will host the website, act as a target for generated traffic, and manage the system.</p>

        <p>Our project will consist mostly of scripts that control the VMware hypervisor, scripts that control the execution of those scripts, and scripts that generate the web interface into the system.  We will also have to do a small amount of embedded level programming to interface with the NI radio.</p>

        <p>So far, our team has encountered numerous challenges. It took about a month for us to get access to the system from the previous group. When we got into their virtual machines, we found that they were unstable and outdated. We basically had to salvage what we could and start rebuilding the system from scratch.</p>

        <p>My role so far</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Salvage usable content from provided virtual machine images</li>
          <li>Build a repository of base images that students will deploy from</li>
          <li>Manage virtualization environment</li>
          <li>Linux system administration</li>
        </ul>
