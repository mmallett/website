        <h2>SE 319 - Algorithms Simplified</h2>
        
        <p>SE 319 is a user interface design course that touches on a handful of GUI technologies. Through this course, I gained experience in Java swing, Javascript, JQuery, and JSP. A semester long project is a major component of this course. With a group of 5, we set out to create an effective way to demonstrate real time execution of algorithms. This tool could be used to show how different algorithms actually function, and to highlight the benefits of better algorithms. Data is sorted on the server, and 'snapshots' of the data are ajaxically sent back to the client. This process is what we defined as a step in the algorithm. The client continues to request steps until the data is sorted. On this project I worked mostly on the front end implementation and interface between the client and server. This interface was built using JSF.</p>

        <p>Projects do not always go as planned, and this was no exception. About 4 weeks into the semester, we lost 2 of our group members. To mitigate this, our remaining group met and discussed what absolutely had to go into the project for a product we would be willing to present. From there, we identified stretch goals of varying priorities to fit in if there was time. With the reduced workload, we were actually better able to divide work up, and easily met our core goals.</p>

        <p>I had an amazing team for this project. Everyone seemed to be very skilled at one facet of the project: I had done a lot of GUI building, and was the only member with solid OpenGL experience, another team member works on large scale computing projects, and already knew a lot about how to get the physics working, the last member was an expert on networking. This type of setup really emphasized the importance of writing easy to use code, because I was the only one that really knew what was going on in the OpenGL code, and vice versa.</p>
